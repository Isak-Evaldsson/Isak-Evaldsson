- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Isak-Evaldsson, and I'm a computer science and engineering student and general computer nerd based in Lund, Sweden.

- ğŸ‘€ I'm interested in most things related to embedded systems and other types lower-level programming. For example computer architecture, c and multicore   programming, operating systems, and graphics. However, my main passion is compilers, and I spend parts of my spare time reading about them and building my own [C--](https://github.com/Isak-Evaldsson/c--) compiler.

- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about graphics, computer architecture and compilers (as always)

- ğŸ’» My favourite languages: Rust and C
